# usrml
User implementation of some ML methods

---
### Currently supports:
  * Linear models: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression
  * Tree: Decision Tree (both classifier and regressor)
  * Ensemble: Gradient boosting (classifier and regressor)
  * Preprocessing: Tf-Idf Vectorizer
  * Model selection: Grid Search (does not support Gradient Boosting)
  * Metrics: rmse, mse, accuracy, recall, precision, f1
---
### Future updates:
  * Random Forest
  * Update to Gradient Descent: batch GD and early stopping
  * Simple Bayesian Grid Search and Feature Importance method for Gradient Boosting

Intended to practice object-oriented programming and Python-based package creation. Any suggestions are welcome at <igrchv@yandex.ru>
