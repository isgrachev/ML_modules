User implementation of some ML methods

---
### Currently supports:
  * Linear models: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression
  * Tree: Decision Tree (both classifier and regressor)
  * Ensemble: Gradient boosting (classifier and regressor)
  * Model selection: Grid Search (does not support Gradient Boosting)
  * Metrics: rmse, mse, accuracy, recall, precision, f1
---
### Future updates:
  * Random Forest
  * Simple Bayesian Grid Search and Feature Importance method for Gradient Boosting
